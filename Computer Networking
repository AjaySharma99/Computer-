A computer network is a system of interconnected devices and computers that communicate with each other to share resources and information.
These networks can range from simple home networks to complex global systems like the Internet. The primary purpose of a computer network is
to enable efficient data exchange, communication, and resource sharing among connected devices.

Key Components of Computer Networks
Nodes:
Nodes are devices connected to the network, including computers, printers, routers, switches, smartphones, and other networking hardware. Each node has a unique address, typically an IP address, that identifies it on the network.

Links:
Links are the physical or wireless connections between nodes. They can be established using various media such as copper wires, fiber-optic cables, or radio waves. The choice of medium affects the speed, bandwidth, and distance of data transmission.

Network Interface Cards (NICs):
NICs are hardware components installed in devices to enable network communication. They provide the physical connection to the network and support communication protocols.

Switches and Routers:

Switches connect devices within a local area network (LAN), forwarding data to the correct destination within the network.
Routers connect different networks, such as a home network to the Internet. They route data between networks and manage traffic by directing data packets to their appropriate destinations.
Protocols:
Protocols are standardized rules that govern data communication in a network. The most common protocol suite is the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), which includes protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS. Protocols define how data is formatted, transmitted, and received.

Network Topologies:
Network topology refers to the arrangement of nodes and connections in a network. Common topologies include:

Bus Topology: All devices are connected to a single central cable.
Star Topology: Devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
Ring Topology: Devices are connected in a circular fashion.
Mesh Topology: Every device is connected to every other device.
Hybrid Topology: A combination of two or more different topologies.
Types of Computer Networks
Local Area Network (LAN):
A LAN is a network confined to a small geographic area, such as a home, office, or building. It connects devices within close proximity and allows them to share resources and information.

Wide Area Network (WAN):
A WAN spans a large geographical area, often consisting of multiple interconnected LANs. The Internet is the largest example of a WAN, connecting millions of devices worldwide.

Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):
A MAN covers a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically a city or campus. It connects multiple LANs to provide broader access to resources.

Personal Area Network (PAN):
A PAN is a small network designed for personal devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, usually within a range of a few meters.

Virtual Private Network (VPN):
A VPN provides a secure, encrypted connection over a public network, such as the Internet. It allows users to access a private network remotely, ensuring data security and privacy.

Network Security
Network security is crucial to protect data and resources from unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches. Key aspects of network security include:

Firewalls: Systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
Encryption: The process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access.
Authentication: Verifying the identity of users and devices before granting access to the network.
Antivirus and Anti-malware: Software that detects and removes malicious software.
Applications of Computer Networks
Communication: Email, instant messaging, video conferencing, and VoIP services enable people to communicate in real-time across the globe.
Resource Sharing: Networks allow multiple users to share hardware (printers, scanners), software (applications), and data (files, databases).
Data Storage and Backup: Centralized servers and cloud services provide data storage, backup, and retrieval options.
Internet Access: Networks connect users to the Internet, providing access to information, services, and entertainment.
E-commerce and Online Services: Networks facilitate online shopping, banking, and other services, offering convenience and accessibility.
