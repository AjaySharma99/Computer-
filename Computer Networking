Introduction to Computer Networks
A computer network is an interconnected collection of devices that communicate and share resources with each other.
These devices, called nodes, can include computers, servers, smartphones, printers, network hardware, and more. 
The main goals of a computer network are to facilitate communication, share resources, and enable distributed computing.

2. Key Components of Computer Networks
2.1 Nodes
Nodes are the endpoints or devices within a network. Each node can send, receive, or process data. Examples include:

Computers (desktops, laptops)
Servers (file servers, web servers)
Printers and Scanners
Routers and Switches
Mobile Devices (smartphones, tablets)
IoT Devices (smart thermostats, cameras)
2.2 Network Media
Network media are the physical or wireless channels through which data is transmitted. Common types include:

Copper Wires: Used in Ethernet cables (e.g., Cat5, Cat6).
Fiber Optic Cables: Use light to transmit data at high speeds over long distances.
Wireless Media: Radio waves used in Wi-Fi, cellular networks, Bluetooth.
2.3 Network Interface Cards (NICs)
NICs are hardware components that allow devices to connect to a network. They can be integrated into the device's 
motherboard or added as external cards. NICs can support wired or wireless connections.

2.4 Switches
Switches are network devices that connect multiple devices within a LAN. They operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) 
of the OSI model, using MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination. Managed switches offer additional features
like VLANs and port mirroring.

2.5 Routers
Routers connect different networks and route data between them. They operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model,
using IP addresses to forward data packets. Routers are crucial for connecting LANs to the Internet.

2.6 Hubs and Bridges
Hubs: Simple devices that broadcast incoming data to all connected devices, regardless of the destination.
Bridges: Devices that connect and filter traffic between two or more network segments.
3. Network Topologies
Network topology refers to the arrangement of nodes and links in a network. It influences network performance, scalability, 
and fault tolerance. Common topologies include:

3.1 Bus Topology
All devices are connected to a single central cable, called the bus. Data travels along the bus, and all devices receive the data, 
but only the intended recipient processes it. This topology is simple but can be inefficient with high traffic.

3.2 Star Topology
All devices are connected to a central hub or switch. The hub acts as a repeater for data flow. This topology is easy to manage
and troubleshoot, but if the central hub fails, the entire network is affected.

3.3 Ring Topology
Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring. Data travels in one direction, passing through each device.
If one device fails, it can disrupt the network unless a dual-ring topology is used.

3.4 Mesh Topology
Each device is connected to every other device. This provides high redundancy and reliability, as data can take multiple paths. 
However, it is expensive and complex to implement.

3.5 Hybrid Topology
A combination of two or more different topologies. For example, a star-bus topology might have several star-configured networks 
connected by a bus backbone.

4. Types of Computer Networks
4.1 Local Area Network (LAN)
A LAN is a network limited to a small geographic area, such as an office, building, or campus. It enables high-speed data
transfer and resource sharing among connected devices. LANs can be wired or wireless (WLAN).

4.2 Wide Area Network (WAN)
A WAN covers a large geographic area, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents. It connects multiple LANs 
and can use various transmission technologies, including leased lines, satellite, and the Internet. The Internet itself 
is the largest WAN.

4.3 Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
A MAN spans a city or large campus, connecting multiple LANs within a specific region. It is larger than a LAN but 
smaller than a WAN, and is often used by universities, large companies, or city governments.

4.4 Personal Area Network (PAN)
A PAN is a small network designed for personal devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops, typically within 
a range of a few meters. Technologies like Bluetooth and USB are common in PANs.

4.5 Virtual Private Network (VPN)
A VPN creates a secure, encrypted connection over a public network, such as the Internet. It allows users to access 
a private network remotely, ensuring data security and privacy.

5. Network Protocols
Protocols are standardized rules and conventions that define how data is transmitted and received in a network. Key protocols include:

5.1 Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)
The foundation of the Internet, consisting of several layers:

Application Layer: Protocols like HTTP (web browsing), FTP (file transfer), SMTP (email).
Transport Layer: Protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable communication and UDP 
(User Datagram Protocol) for faster, but less reliable, communication.
Network Layer: IP (Internet Protocol), responsible for addressing and routing data packets.
Link Layer: Protocols for physical addressing, such as Ethernet.
5.2 Ethernet
A widely used LAN protocol that defines how data is formatted and transmitted over wired connections. 
It supports data transfer rates from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps and beyond.

5.3 Wi-Fi
A wireless networking technology based on the IEEE 802.11 standards. It enables devices to connect to a 
network wirelessly within a certain range.

5.4 HTTP/HTTPS
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its secure version (HTTPS) are protocols for transferring 
hypertext (web pages) over the Internet.

5.5 DNS
Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses 
that computers use to identify each other on the network.

5.6 SMTP, POP3, IMAP
Protocols used for sending and receiving emails. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used for sending, 
while POP3 (Post Office Protocol) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) are used for retrieving.

6. Network Security
Network security is essential to protect data and resources from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, 
and other threats. Key aspects of network security include:

6.1 Firewalls
Devices or software that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on 
predetermined security rules. They can block or allow traffic to protect the network from external threats.

6.2 Encryption
The process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. Encryption is crucial for 
protecting sensitive information during transmission.

6.3 Authentication
Verifying the identity of users and devices before granting access to the network. Common methods 
include passwords, biometrics, and two-factor authentication.

6.4 Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)
Systems that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and can take actions to prevent potential threats.

6.5 Virtual Private Network (VPN)
As mentioned earlier, VPNs provide secure, encrypted connections over public networks, protecting data and privacy.

6.6 Antivirus and Anti-malware
Software that detects, prevents, and removes malicious software, such as viruses, worms, and ransomware.
